I haven't had the time i would have liked to devote to these end of year lists, but I'm going to try and throw something together anyway. It is difficult to organise this when all my music is in boxes and piles all over my flat. Here are some albums, in no order at all, that I have really enjoyed this year:

  I'm sure I have missed some obvious ones. I will try and add more as I think of them. Sorry, this is quite a boring list of obvious stuff, apart from the 2 Scottish bands. I will try harder with the other lists, but I just don't have much time

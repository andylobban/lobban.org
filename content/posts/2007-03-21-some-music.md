I have just come home to find loads too many emails and blog feed items about music and bands. I feel the need to share for some reason. 

If you like twee pop (I do) then you might like a band that tried to friend Black Tape on myspace. They are called <span class="nametext"><a href="http://www.myspace.com/amidaband">Amida</a>, they are from Manchester, and that's all </span>I know. They are cheering up my sleepy day.

  Meanwhile, an email alerted me to the fact that it looks like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motormark">Motormark</a>, along with what looks like at least one member of <a href="http://www.lapsuslinguae.co.uk/">Lapsus Linguae</a>, have become <a href="http://www.fakefang.com/">Fake Fang</a>. Tracks streaming on their <a href="http://www.myspace.com/fakefang">myspace</a> sound ace. This makes me happy. They play Glasgow next weekend. I will try to make it.</p>

    And lastly for now, browsing my Vox neighbourhood has led me to <a href="http://successlessness.vox.com/library/post/stars-this-charming-man.html">this lovely cover</a> over at <a class="enclosure-inline-user" href="http://weheartmusic.vox.com/">We♥Music</a> that I expected to hate (I love <a href="http://www.arts-crafts.ca/stars/">Stars</a> but I hate their Pogues cover, and I rarely like any Smiths covers by anyone) but I actually kind of adore. Give it a chance, please.</div>

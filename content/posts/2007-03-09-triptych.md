The Triptych lineup has been announced and as usual it's pretty excellent. 5 days of quality bands that don't play here very often, if at all. Now the dilemma of who to see. I have a ticket for Low in Glasgow on the Thursday night (not part of Triptych), which is good, but also bad as I have seen them about 6 times already and there are 2 excellent looking gigs on the same night in Edinburgh. So, assuming that I can scrape together some cash to buy tickets before anything sells out, what should I go to? One per night, possibility of a second late one on either Friday Or Saturday. Hmmm.

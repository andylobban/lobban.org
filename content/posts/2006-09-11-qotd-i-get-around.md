> How many places have you lived in your life?

2 countries, 3 cities and 9 houses.

i was born in winnipeg, canada, where i apparently lived for about 8 months or something, before my parents took me home to scotland.

i then lived in a few different houses in aberdeen till i was 18.

then i moved to edinburgh to go to uni, and have lived there ever since, in 4 different flats so far.

If you love live music in the UK, you need to read this, from the latest Wichita Recordings newsletter:

> On to a more serious noteâ€¦it has been brought to attention that the government wish to consider it a legal requirement in the new tax year to introduce laws insisting anyone applying or re-applying for an entertainment license must have a noise control device fitted to the venue. This will be the final NAIL for ALL entertainment in the UK as the level at which these devices CUT you off is dreadfully low and damaging.

**
  
PLEASE DO NOT INTRODUCE THIS LAW, WE LOVE LIVE MUSIC!**

I don't normally do this, but I saw the new [SimpleBits][1] today, and I just had to show people how pretty it is. It might just be my mood, but for some reason this is the most inspiring piece of new web design I have seen in a very long time. Clean, elegant, classic, but playful at the same time. I absolutely love it. And if you like that sort of thing, the content is great too.

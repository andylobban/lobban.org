Most people who build for the web agree that trying to use Flash on anything to be used by mobile devices is a bad idea. Most people, however, don&#8217;t keep up with the state of the web as closely as we do. In the last few weeks we&#8217;ve had a couple of clients ask us about adding Flash content to a site that will be used by mobile devices as well as traditional computers&#8217;. I have collated some information on the subject which might give you a better understanding of the current situation, or help you explain it your clients.

## Mobile Flash Support

Mobile device use is on the rise, which means most websites are being visited by mobile users to some extent. Using Flash content in these situations should be avoided if possible, or at least used with an appropriate fallback.

  * As many people know, iPhones, iPads and iPods have never supported Flash.
  * Adobe’s Flash player browser plugin for Android is no longer available to new users in the Google Play Store. The existing Flash Player is [not compatible with Android OS 4.1][2]. All this means that any new Android devices sold now will never have Flash support.
  * RIM [dropped Flash support from BB OS 7][3] in 2011.
  * (Not mobile, but worth noting) Apple [stopped shipping Flash Player with new Macs][4] in 2010. Users can still install Flash Player themselves.

## Some stats from our clients&#8217; sites

### International sport organisation&#8217;s e-commerce site, last month

  * Mobile visits with Flash installed: 2.25%
  * Mobile visits without Flash installed: 97.75%

### Large UK retail chain&#8217;s e-commerce site, last month

  * Mobile visits with Flash installed: 5%
  * Mobile visits without Flash installed: 95%

Besides, animated GIFs are more fun anyway.

To the girl in front of me at the <a href="http://www.flaminglips.com/" target="_blank">Flaming Lips</a> gig last night: thank you so much for trying to hit one of the balloons but actually just ripping my glasses off my face and sending them flying forward never to be seen again. Thank you for then acting like you didnâ€™t know you had done it, then a few minutes later moving to a space a bit behind me so as to not feel as bad any more. Thank you for setting you idiot male friend on my girlfriend to shout all up in her face. Thanks for hiding behind your pal. Thanks. 

To the Flaming Lips, however, thank you sincerely for puttin on one of the best gigs i have ever seen, and putting a massive smile on my face regardless of anything else.

When I was in Australia in December, we walked past a junk shop in a small town where 3 old box cameras caught my eye. After a little haggling, I walked out with a [Box Brownie No.2 Model E][1], with unknown film still in it.

When I got home, I took the camera toÂ [a lab][2], who kindly figured out in their darkroom how to remove the 120 film. They estimated by looking at the backing paper that the film was at least 30 years old. Sadly, on developing it, we found there were only 4 photos, all incredibly faded landscapes. No people, or recognisable landmarks. Just lots of degradation and rust. I have no idea where they were shot, or even if it was in Australia. The camera was made between 1920 and 1924, made (and presumably sold) in the US.

The four shots were actually 2 pairs of the same shot. These are the 2 (slightly) better versions. I thought they were interesting, and I like the rough and ghostly quality they have.

I&#8217;m going to take the camera out with a new film at the weekend and see if I can figure out how to take some photos with it.

Obviously this is a pointless task, but someone asked us at Off The Beaten Tracks to write a top ten, so i did. Except I couldn&#8217;t get it down to less than 11, so here they are, in no particular order:

  * The Pains of Being Pure at Heart &#8211; The Pains of Being Pure at Heart
  * St Vincent &#8211; Actor
  * Fanfarlo &#8211; Reservoir
  * The Antlers &#8211; Hospice
  * The Xcerts &#8211; In The Cold Wind We Smile
  * Discovery &#8211; Discovery
  * Animal Collective &#8211; Merriweather Post Pavilion
  * Japandroids &#8211; Post-Nothing
  * The xx &#8211; xx
  * French Miami &#8211; French Miami
  * Casiotone For the Painfully Alone &#8211; vs. Children

I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve overlooked at least one important one. Just for fun, what are yours?

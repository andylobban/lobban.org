  As I may or may not have already talked about my new employment. Or self-employment, more accurately. As of 6th April I will be trading as <a href="http://www.nonimage.com">Nonimage</a>, doing freelance design work for web and print. My main client is my old employer, and I will be working as part of <a href="http://www.cheerfactory.co.uk">Cheer Factory</a> also, but on top of that I need to find extra work. I have some coming in, but obviously I'm on the lookout for more. So if you want anything done, or know someone who does, please get in touch. Thanks. I appreciate it.</p>

    I officially finish my job on Friday, so I have next week to get things sorted out and tie up some loose ends (like a proper SXSW post here), ready to start with a vengeance the week after next. I am really excited about working for myself, and I'm pretty confident about it going well, but at the same time i am (understandably, I suppose) petrified.

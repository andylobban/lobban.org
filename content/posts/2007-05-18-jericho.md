I am actually very sad to hear today that CBS in America has cancelled Jericho. Aparently so few people watched it that you probably dont know what Im talking about. Jericho is a drama series about a small town in middle America that deals in its own ways with a massive nuclear attack on many large American cities. It was amazing. And now it has been cancelled due to poor ratings, and I actually feel deflated that it wont be back for series 2, and that series 1 ended with no conclusion, and very few questions answered. Ive never actually cared much about a TV show before, and its weird. Go and find the first series and watch it. Its great.

Meursault &#8211; William Henry Miller Pt.1 ([The Waiting Room][1] Session)

I put on a gig in Edinburgh last night, and I feel the need to tell you about all 3 bands who played because they&#8217;re all bloody marvellous.

First on was [X Lion Tamer][2]. Not only is Tony a good (but cockney) guy, his 80s pop inspired electronics and early New Order-like guitar noodling are amazing. It&#8217;s a shame he hasn&#8217;t really had many chances to play to big crowds yet, but there was a decent amount of people last night.

[Honeytrap][3] are from Coventry, live in London, have a drummer in Coventry and a drummer in London, and their bass player is from Edinburgh. Confused? Me too. They&#8217;re dead good though. &#8216;Bar Mitzvah Indie&#8217; is the phrase I&#8217;m sticking with. We&#8217;ve got an [Off The Beaten Tracks][4] session with them this afternoon, which I&#8217;m really looking forward to.

[Meursault][5] are fucking brilliant. Last night they somehow seemed more brilliant. I may have imagined it, but Neil seemed to be taking out all his anger towards the talkers at the bar on his vocals. The new [Nothing Broke EP][6] is brilliant, so go and buy it.

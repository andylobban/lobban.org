I am overjoyed to learn that Cadburys have bowed to internet pressure, and [are to bring back the Wispa][1]. This is amazing news. Perhaps they will have a midnight opening at corner shops around the country for the relaunch. It could be like Harry Potter books or Radiohead albums, big queues, 'copies' signed by Cadbury staff, free giveaways of Fudge bars for the first hundred throught the door. Fanatics dressed as their favourite Wispa bubble. 

I'd go.

Link: [Ra Ra Riot on Daytrotter][1]

A video well worth watching.

From [Daytrotter][1]:

> Pretty girls doing cartwheels and blowing the white and fluffy seeds off the tops of dandelions, all in a flush and greened out Salt Lake City Park &#8212; a place where Brigham Young presumably thought a rose could grow out of a desert. Then there is a song playing, a pretty song, and you realize fairly suddenly that you are watching and living Ra Ra Riot&#8217;s essence as if it were some delightful dream fragrance. It feels as if the moment &#8212; accented with sunbursts and sun blotchings exquisitely covering silhouettes in whites and yellows &#8212; is loving you right back. It&#8217;s the way the New York-based band tends to always make one feel.

The second (and so far last) episode, recorded with Ian live on Fresh Air on 9th August 2012.

This time we had more technical difficulties, in that our intrepid producer Christian forgot to record the first part of the show. So it starts rather abruptly at the start of the Happy Particles song. We hope you enjoy the songs. Go and buy some of them if you do like them.

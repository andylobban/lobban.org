Late you say? Well yes, but I've been busy.

  And I'm still too busy to do this properly, so I shall quickly list some stuff that rocked my world in 2007.

  SXSW was one of the best things I've done in a long time. i can't wait to do it all again in 2 months, this time with for Interactive and Music (and Film, although I'm not sure how much of that I'll see). Going to Ibiza off season was a great experience and just the relaxing time I needed. Continuing Black Tape has been great fun, especially having our first band, Broken Records.&#160;I started my&#160;own freelance business, which has been incredibly rewarding and fun so far, and pleasing successful for a new startup. I really am very lucky to be doing this.

  My 4 new obsessions from 2007 were Cut Off Your Hands, Ra Ra Riot, Broken Records and Black Kids (in order of discovery). I also was loving Kissaway Trail, Jens Lekman, Twilight Sad, Menomena, Seasick Steve, Beirut, Low, Malcolm Middleton, Justice, Simian Mobile Disco, Voxtrot, The Hold Steady, Radiohead, Modest Mouse, Gruff Rhys, Field Music, Battles, Someone Still Loves You Boris Yeltsin, CSS, You Say Party! We Say Die!, Frightened Rabbit, Fujiya & Miyagi&#8230;and a huge amount more that I cant think of right now. Plus the usual stuff I have loved for years.

Oh and Josh Ritter.

  I'm no film Buff, and I can't really remember what films I saw that I liked. Superbad was funny. If you are interested in visual culture at all, Helvetica is a documentary worth watching. And while I havent actually got round to sitting down with peace and quiet to watch it yet, the trailer for Heima, the Sigur Ros documentary looks incredible.

  <a href="http://www.panic.com/coda/">Coda</a> is amazing and has changed the way I work. <a href="http://acejet170.typepad.com/">Ace Jet 170</a> is my favourite discovery, blog-wise. It gets me wanting to go out and find great old design stuff.

  And that's all I have time for, which is a shame. So much more I want to say. Maybe I will soon.

> What's your favorite way to keep in touch? Phone, snail mail, email, text message, Vox, \_____ ?

i suppose my favourite way(as in the best way and the one i use most frequently) is email, because it caan be as long or as short as you want, and its "written" down so you can get important information across easily, and it gets sent instantly. of course it helps that i sit in front of a computer all day at work and have one in my flat. 

but obviously snail mail is my actual favourite way. there is nothing better than getting an actual letter from a friend in the post. (god, this is so predictable, i suppose everyone will be saying this). lauar and i kept it up for a while when she moved to australia, and it was great, but unfortunately the modern world seems to dictate to us that time 'wasted' writing a letter could be better employed doing something far less satisfactory. so what with babies and moving (her) and general apathy, alcohol and a girlfriend, that hjas kinda fallen by the wayside. crap, i know. in fact, i am going to try really hard to write her a letter and make her somethign tomorrow. i will probably fail though.

laura, i miss ye pal.

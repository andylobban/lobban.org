i have 6 computers in my flat. 

of the 6, five are mine, one is lois', 3 are in regular use, 2 are broken, 3 are laptops, 1 is a server, 1 runs (or should) linux, 1 runs windows and 4 are macs.

the run down:

1. lois' hp laptop. runs windows xp. has not worked for about 3 months, as it needs a nw power unit, which can only come from hp directly. hasn't been fixed due to laziness, cost and the fact that she uses my powerbook.

2. apple classic ll. runs mac os 7 (i think). does actually work (i think). i havent had this on yet. i got it for free, and i dont really know what to do with it. i quite fancy making some sort of retro art type thing, or maybe make it into a fish tank.

3. advent laptop. about 6 yeras old, big and heavy. sort of runs linux, but wont install any linux apart from the ones that wont work with my ethernet card. will run off a live cd, but too slowly to actually be useful. i think there might be somethign wrong with the cd drive. i wanted to make it into a music jukebox for the kitchen in my old flat, but it didnt really work. one day i will make it work properly.

4. apple powerbook g4 12". my baby. ive had it 3 years now, and its still going strong. i just added an airport extreme card. plays video to the tv in the bedroom and plays tunes all over the flat, all streamed from the server. gets carted around to meetings and such. will be much more portable when i manage to find anyone with any stock of 12" powerbook batteries. mine lasts about 20 mins at the moment. this was my only computer for ages and its amazing. it changed the way i used computers. my first mac. i love her.

5. apple intel core duo 20" imac. the workhorse. has 1.25gb of ram and it flies. most powerfull computer i have ever used by a long way. massive bright screen, beautiful to look at. used for all my design work, video editing, photos etc.  
may be used to watch movies in the spare bedroom once it is decorated.

6. apple g4 mac mini. the server. doesnt have a monitor, but is hooked up to the main tv in the living room. plays video files and dvds on the main tv, plays music to the stereo (all the music i own is ripped to the server, so i can play any of my music on the stereo or stream it to the imac or powerbook), acts as a basic web server, a torrent server and acts as general file storage to serve to the other 2 macs and certain people over the internet.

i'm a geek, what can i say?</p>

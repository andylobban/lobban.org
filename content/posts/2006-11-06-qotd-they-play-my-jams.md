> What's your favorite radio station, past or present?

im not a huge radio fan to be honest. i listen to [xfm scotland][1] all day at work, which is not bad, probably better than any other daytime radio in terms of music. [radio 1][2] has better chat, but xfm has the best music. its pretty much just background noise though. i mostly listen to the radio for pleasure is weekday evenings, and at this time radio 1 is my favourite and always has been. it plays the best and most varied selection of the type of music i like (mostly indie/rock stuff with a bit of hip hop and electronica), from the sorely missed john peel, to steve lamaq when i was growing up, to todays zane lowe and colin murray. there just isn't anything to beat it. i'm sure there would be if i lived in london, but i dont.

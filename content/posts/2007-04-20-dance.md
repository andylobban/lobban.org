I'm compiling a huge amount of CD-Rs to use for DJing so I have all my dancy songs in one folder and I don't have to cart around loads of my real CDs and get them all scratched and stolen.

But I'm looking for more. Can anyone recommend some good songs guaranteed to make you dance that I might not already know or own.

Cheers

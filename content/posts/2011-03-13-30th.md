Lois an I are in New York for a couple of days for my 30th birthday, before heading to SXSW in Austin. Yesterday was the best birthday ever. We went up the [Rockefeller Centre][2] for the view which was sunny and great, went for Lois&#8217; first American [diner breakfast][3], went on the [Staten Island Ferry][4], saw the Statue of Liberty, Battery Park, the Financial District, then went to Greenwich Village. Did some record shopping in [Other Music][5], then hit a [Mexican place][6] for Frozen Margaritas. A bit drunk, we headed to Williamsburg and had an awesome dinner at [Walter Foods][7], then went to the [Knitting Factory][8] and saw [The Loom][9] (really good), [Pepper Rabbit][10] (a bit disappointing live) and [Rural Alberta Advantage][11] (great).

A good day all in all. Time for more, though. We are off to see the [Knicks][12] play at Madison Square Garden tonight. Tomorrow we head to Austin.

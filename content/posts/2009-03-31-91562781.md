Link: [“slotMusic™”: High Quality, DRM-Free MP3 Music on microSD™ Cards][1]

Words cannot describe how bad an idea I think this is. I was handed one of these at SXSW last week. Great, some free music. Why not. Pay for an album on one of those? Hell no. How many devices actually have a MicroSD slot these days anyway? I&#8217;m willing to bet it&#8217;s not any close to enough to make this worthwhile. People do not want their media on another format which will be dead in a few years time. Music industry: you are getting worse, not better.

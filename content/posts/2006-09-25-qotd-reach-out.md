> Is there a friend who you owe a phonecall or email? What's stopping you?

god, there are quite a few. i have not been good at keeping up with my friends lately. thats what comes from being a bit skint, a bit ill, a bit busy with work, but mostly just being useless.

so to any of you that read this, i am sorry i havent been in touch that much (or at all) lately. 

i will make things better, starting today.

i promise.

Went to see <a href="http://www.chosendarkness.com/" target="_blank">ILYBICD</a> at <a href="http://www.kingtuts.co.uk/" target="_blank">King Tut’s</a> a week past friday. I had been waiting to see them since I got tickets months ago. They were really good. Not incredible, but really good. Maybe I just wasn’t in the mood. Supporting were <a href="http://www.catfishhaven.com/" target="_blank">Catfish Haven</a> and <a href="http://www.audrey.se/" target="_blank">Audrey</a>, who were also both good. A pleasant surprise was the addition of <a href="http://www.howtoswim.net/" target="_blank">How To Swim</a> as the first support band. Great as always. More fotos <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/nonimage/sets/72157594376459701/" target="_blank">here</a>. A wee video to come at some point too.

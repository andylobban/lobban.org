my browser's default home page is set to be blank. can you see this is going to be another not great post?  
if i had to choose an actual page instead of blank, it would either be [gmail][1] or my [backpack][2] homepage, for obvious reasons. if i was to pick something else, i guess i would choose something like [the show][3], my current favourite, or maybe something like [letters to marc jacobs][4]. funny, weird and sad all in one.

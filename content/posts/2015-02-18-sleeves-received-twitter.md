[The Wire][1] run a [Tumblr blog called Sleeves Received][2] which features some of the lovely, weird and wonderful packaging from releases they&#8217;re sent. As a label owner, record nerd, and designer, this is pretty much the best Tumblr for me. Since I&#8217;ve given up RSS and moved to following sites on Twitter if I absolutely need to follow, Sleeves Received has been missing from my life. So I used [IFTTT][3] to pipe the RSS feed from the site to a Twitter account, so it tweets new posts. Follow if you&#8217;re interested.

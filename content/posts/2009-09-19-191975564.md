We had an amazing short holiday on the west coast, staying on Loch Lochy. We chilled out a lot, we drove up the road to Mallaig, we lay on the beach, and generally had an amazing relaxing time. We stopped at a remote, deserted beach near Arisaig that Iâ€™d been to 8 years ago, and I proposed to Lois on the beach. Amazingly she said yes.

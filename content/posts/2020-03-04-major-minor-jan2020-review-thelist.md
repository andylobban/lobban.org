I've taken my daughter to a few [Major Minor](https://www.facebook.com/majorminormusicclub/) events, and was asked to write a few words about the latest one, featuring [Martha Ffion](https://www.facebook.com/marthaffionmckay/).

  * Kathryn Joseph &#8211; From When I Wake the Want Is
  * Waxahatchee &#8211; Great Thunder EP

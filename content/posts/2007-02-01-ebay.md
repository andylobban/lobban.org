Yesterday I started by first ever Ebay auction. And my second and third. I was pleasantly surprised at how easy and straightforward it was. So far, 2 of the items, the debut single by [Stereophonics][1] and a rare [White Stripes][2] live single, are doing well, especially the White Stripes CD, so I'm pretty pleased. If you're interested the links to my auctions are below:

[White Stripes &#8211; The Denial Twist Live From Glasgow 14/11/05 CD][3]

[Stereophonics &#8211; Looks Like Chaplin/More Life In A Tramps Vest Debut Single CD][4]

[Stylecam DV100 Video Camera][5]

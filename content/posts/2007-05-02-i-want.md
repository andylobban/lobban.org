&#8230;a wifi powered, waterproof touchscreen bit of hardware that goes in my shower. it uses the wifi to track rss feeds which i pick using my computer during setup, ans which i can scroll through and choose between using a super simple touch interface. that way i can check the bbc news, watch a wee podcast, and maybe listen to an internet radio station while i have a long hot shower.

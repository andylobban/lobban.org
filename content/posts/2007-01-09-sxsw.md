Well, its all finally booked, we are officially going to [SXSW][1]. Colin, Brian, Cas and I are flying out to Austin, Texas on 12th March, for a week of music and booze. Although I have obsessively searched for information and helful hints, we really don't hugely know what we are letting ourselves into. Any help appreciated.

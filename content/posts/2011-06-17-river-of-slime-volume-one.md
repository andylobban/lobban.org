> apparently the samples in it have got something to do with ghostbusters 2, which means nothing to me, i never even seen ghostbusters. jc usually finds himself in shock every time i see him, when he finds out i haven’t seen some film that mostly everyone else has seen. when was i supposed to have seen these movies? i’ve seen _what women want_, if that helps matters at all?

> If you could watch _any_ movie on the big screen right at this moment, what would it be?

i am a big fan of seeing older film on the big screen, after seeing [alien][1] at a midnight showing at the [cameo][2] a few years back. it was in the cinema originally before i was even born. i think actions films benefit from the big screen most, so i guess i would go for an action film that is too old for me to have seen it in the cinema the first time round. 

so probably something like the original [star wars][3]. i'm sure it has been on in the cinema over the years, but i have never been to see it.

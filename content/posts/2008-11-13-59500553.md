> [Mitch Mitchell, the last surviving member of the Jimi Hendrix Experience, has died.][2]
> 
> The drummer in one of the world’s most influential rock bands was found dead in a hotel room in Portland, Oregon in the early hours of Wednesday November 12. He was 61.
> 
> Alongside Hendrix and bass player Noel Redding, the trio formed in 1966 and released their debut album Are You Experienced? in 1967, going on to make Axis: Bold As Love and Electric Ladyland before dissolving in 1970, shortly before Hendrix’s death. Redding died in 2003.

A hugely underrated drummer, just as good as the Moons and Bonhams of this world.

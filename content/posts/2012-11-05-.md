I just received my copy of [Pendle, 1612][1] from [Folklore Tapes][2].

> Curated by [Rob St John][3] and [David Chatton Barker][4], and limited to 200 copies, the tapes are packaged in a screen printed heritage library buckram box which houses information and ephemera related to the trials: a map, photographs, an essay by the curators, and a dried nettle in glassvine envelope as well as a download code.
> 
> &#8216;Pendle, 1612&#8217; is the first release through the new Lancashire Folk Tapes imprint, following the continuing Devon Folklore series of limited edition tape releases exploring British folklore.
  
> This release is a commemoration and remembrance to the Pendle Witch trials &#8211; a reminder of the rich, dark and entangled histories that are increasingly paved over and forgotten by contemporary celebrations.

Basically, it&#8217;s a curated compilation tape of what you might (sometimes loosely) call folk music, about the witch trials in an area of Lancashire in the 17th Century. This is all wrapped up in a beautiful box with all sorted of little bits and bobs to keep you interested while you listen, including a written history of the subject matter.

I thought it deserved a photo.

Just as I did [last year][1], I submitted my top 5 albums of 2010 to Peenko’s BAMS list. You can view the [collective results of that list][2], of which some of my top 5 were featured. However, I’m not that keen on ranking records in order, so here are those 5 plus a bunch more, in absolutely no order (and apologies to the host of great records I will only remember to include once this is posted).

  * The National &#8211; High Violet
  * Best Coast &#8211; Crazy For You
  * Meursault &#8211; All Creatures Will Make Merry
  * The Japanese War Effort &#8211; I Will Leave You Now, And Two Loudspeakers Will Take My Place
  * Pantha Du Prince &#8211; Black Noise
  * Gold Panda &#8211; Lucky Shiner
  * Yusuf Azak &#8211; Turn on the Long Wire
  * The Phantom Band &#8211; The Wants
  * Field Music – Measure
  * Mitchell Museum – The Peter’s Port Memorial Service
  * Bear in Heaven – Beast Rest Forth Mouth
  * Broken Records &#8211; Let Me Come Home
  * LCD Soundsystem – This Is Happening
  * Laura Marling &#8211; I Speak Because I Can
  * Errors &#8211; Come Down With Me
  * Timber Timbre &#8211; Timber Timbre
  * Broken Social Scene – Forgiveness Rock Record
  * The Scottish Enlightenment – St. Thomas
  * Port-royal &#8211; Dying in Time (Yes, it was released in 2009. I don’t care.)
  * The Unwinding Hours – The Unwinding Hours
  * Sufjan Stevens &#8211; Age Of Adz
  * Teenage Fanclub &#8211; Shadows
  * Arcade Fire – The Suburbs
  * Wooden Shjips – Vol. 2
  * Local Natives &#8211; Gorilla Manor
  * Foals &#8211; Total Life Forever

You should go and buy some of these. Go on.

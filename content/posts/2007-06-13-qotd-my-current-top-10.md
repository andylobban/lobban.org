2. Expectations &#8211; Cut Off Your Hands  
3. Takes Slowly Over &#8211; Cut Off Your Hands  
4. Let Go &#8211; Cut Off Your Hands  
5. Network! Network! Network! &#8211; [Dartz!][2]  
6. Once, Twice, Again! &#8211; Dartz!  
7. Tell Me About &#8211; Cut Off Your Hands  
8. A Simple Hypothetical &#8211; Dartz!

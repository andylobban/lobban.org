> Did you dress up today?&#160; See any good costumes?

nah. im a bit to old and grump for that stuff. have i seen any good costumes? a few quite funny ones in town over the weekend. by funny i mean girls who think that dressing in next to nothing as a nurse or a "sexy" vampire is acceptable even though are really way too big and pale to let it all hang oot.

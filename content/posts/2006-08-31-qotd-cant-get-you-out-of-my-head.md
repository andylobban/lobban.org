at the moment, patins by [css][1]. its the second track off an album i just can't stop listening to right now.   
it's that damn catchy pop chorus i can't get enough of.

whenever i look at you  
i don't know what to do  
whenever you talk to me  
i don't know what is true  
tell me what to believe

n the most poetic thing ever, but try listening to it and not shaking yer hips. i don't listen to nearly as much upbeat music as i used too (getting old), so this really is a breath of fresh air.

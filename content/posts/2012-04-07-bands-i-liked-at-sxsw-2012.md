For the people who asked, before I forget.

I made a Spotify playlist with a track from each (Dive, Ume and Cities Aviv don&#8217;t have anything on Spotify) &#8211;Â [The Best of SXSW 2012][1]

In the order I saw them:

  * Grave Babies
  * Thee Oh Sees
  * Brown Brogues
  * The Twilight Sad
  * Tammar
  * Bleached
  * Craft Spells
  * Wet Hair
  * Ume
  * Dive
  * Lower Dens (included because I really like their records but they were bad live, again)
  * Friends
  * Japandroids
  * Youth Lagoon
  * Danny Brown
  * Cities Aviv
  * Peaking Lights
  * Alabama Shakes
  * Bruce Springsteen
  * Jimmy Cliff
  * Burnt Ones
  * Gardens & Villa
  * We Were Promised Jetpacks
  * Titus Andronicus
  * Prince Rama
  * Ganglians
  * Grimes
  * Blackalicious
  * Bear in Heaven
  * A$AP Rocky (It was entertaining at least)
  * Airbird
  * Javelin
  * Django Django

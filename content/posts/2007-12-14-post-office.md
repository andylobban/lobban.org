A true story about the Post Office:

Today I went to the Post Office for some stamps for work. I asked for a book of stamps, and asked for a reciept. I then handed over my Switch card to pay. I was told that I couldn't buy stamps with a card, as she had already rung it through as cash. I asked if she could ring it through again as a card instead, to which I was told that it would make her till short, so no, she could not. I actually just laughed. She eventually did ring it through as a card, while giving me a stern telling off for not stating that I wanted to pay by card. She almost sent me away without stamps because of this.

And the Post Office and Royal Mail wonder why they are in trouble financially.

Ideally it would be the west coast of Scotland, round about Fort William and Mallaig, but that's a tad extreme, so normally it would be the top of [Arthur's Seat][1]. It's in the middle of the city, but when you get up there it is so quiet, and you can see the whole of Edinburgh and over to Fife. I love it up there.

I love Bandcamp. Every week I get an email with new music that people I follow have bought. I&#8217;ve been listening to loads of new stuff the last couple of days. Here are some good bits and pieces you might like.

  * [II by Sheer Mag][1]
  * [C&#8217;Mon Mother Fuckers, Let&#8217;s Dance! (Live At Audio)Â by Megalomatic][2]
  * [Waaves x Cloud Nothings][3]
  * [King of Blah by Frog][4]
  * [Colors by Triptides][5]
  * [Sad Girls Clubbing comp][6]

> If you could write a book about anything, what would it be about?

i would love to write children's books. i guess everyone says that, don't they. i don't know if i would be any good at it. i tried making up a children's story on the spot for lois as a laugh one night, and i got laughed at. a lot. so maybe not children's books.

i probably have more knowledge about some musical subject. being about the only thing i really really care about, and being a bit of a geek, i suppose this subject would be the best for me to tackle. i'm not sure what particular part though. maybe the scottish music scene from the 50s onwards? not that i am any sort of expert on that, but i would really get into it, as i am really interested. and i haven't seen a book on the subject before.

maybe i should just write softcore smut for [mills & boon][1].

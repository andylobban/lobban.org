I finally had a chance last night to edit and upload a lot of photos I&#8217;ve taken over the last month or so.

## Paws video shoot Holga shots

My love affair with my Holga continues, despite the crazy costs. Some rather surreal photos from the [Paws][1] video shoot.

## Ballater

We spent a weekend in Ballater with lots of very old friends, and it was awesome. I&#8217;ve omitted the stupid drinking photos for once.

## Some more Holga shots

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1469215981" title="5978689427_baedc8897a" src="https://lobban.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/5978689427_baedc8897a.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="500" srcset="https://lobban.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/5978689427_baedc8897a.jpg 500w, https://lobban.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/5978689427_baedc8897a-150x150.jpg 150w, https://lobban.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/5978689427_baedc8897a-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" />

Some random Holga shots from around the place. Shoot black and white for the first time with this camera.

## T in the Park

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1469215982" title="5978762209_46e5d045b8" src="https://lobban.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/5978762209_46e5d045b8.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="338" srcset="https://lobban.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/5978762209_46e5d045b8.jpg 500w, https://lobban.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/5978762209_46e5d045b8-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" />

Some digital photos alongside the first roll of film shot with my new Canon AE-1. I was a bit worried they&#8217;d all come out terribly as I didn&#8217;t have much time to work out how to use the camera, but they came out pretty well, I think, for a first try.

See them on Flickr &#8211; [Digital][5] / [Film][6]

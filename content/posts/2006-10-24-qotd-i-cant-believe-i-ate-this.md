i cant honestly remember eating anything that weird. i at a weird chicken thing in oman, but i dont really remember much about it.

but my friend murray used to eat tabbies. for those who dont understand, tabbies are used cigarette butts. seriously. he used to pick them up out of the ashtray and eat one for money. but then sometimes we would only club together like 20 pence and still he would do it. i'm pretty sure that he ate one for free once. weirdo.

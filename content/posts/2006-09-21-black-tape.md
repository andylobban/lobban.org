Click on the flyer above to view a more readable version. I would love to see any of you down there on the night. The blurb:

**BLACK TAPE
  
SECOND THURDAY OF EACH MONTH
  
11PM-3AM
  
COCTEAU LOUNGE** (Downstairs at Ego)  
**Â£3 ENTRY
  
DRINKS PROMOS** Lots of drinks for less than 2 quid 

None of this glamourous DJ nonsense. None of the bandwagon jumping. We play good music. And you can too. 

Think of a new track you're bursting to share with the rest of the
  
world. Think of those amazing early tracks by bands that now fill
  
bloated stadiums. Think of those album tracks inspiring air guitar and
  
singing in the mirror that never appear on an A side. Think of those
  
tunes you used to wait all night for in clubs that have disappeared out
  
of fashion. Think of a divine mix of indie, classic pop, rock, soul,
  
punk, electronica, and perhaps a little hip hop that leaves you in a
  
heap on the dancefloor at the end of the night. Black Tape plays these
  
tracks, and then asks YOU to have a go at playing them yourself.
  
Remember what it feels like to finish a mix tape for a friend and you
  
look at the tracklisting and just wish you could broadcast it to the
  
entire world? Well now you can, at least to a bunch of like-minded
  
people in a club. 

We are giving half-hour DJ slots to ANYONE that wants one &#8211; providing
  
you can make an impression and make people dance. If YOU want to DJ at
  
the first ever Black Tape, please email us at <blacktape@nonimage.com>
  
with a sample list of tunes you might play. If we like it (or we think
  
everyone else might like it) we will ask you to send us a mix CD. It
  
doesn't have to be mixed and beat matched and all that bollocks. Just a
  
mix of tracks you think would get the party going, burnt to a CD. Bear
  
in mind that if you get to play at Black Tape, you will be
  
unceremoniously removed from the decks (don't worry though, it's all
  
just a laugh, we will probably remove each other a few times during the
  
night.) 

For every Black Tape after that, you can either email us at the address
  
above, or just hand in a mix CD on the night, with you name, email and
  
a tracklisting for your CD.

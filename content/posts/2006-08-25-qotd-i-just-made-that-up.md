> Remember [sniglets][1]?&#160; Do you have any favorites?&#160; Have you ever made up your own word?&#160; (Now's as good a time as any.)

never heard of them before. but now that i have looked up what it means, i like the idea of it. im sure i have made up many words, but i can actually think of any now.

brumbies. that's a good one. not that it's mine. it means man tits.  
the one i hate most if smirting. ie: smoking and flirting, a phenomenon brought about by the recent ban on smoking in public places in various countries, including here in scotland.

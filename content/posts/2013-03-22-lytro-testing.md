While I was in Austin, I was given a [Lytro camera][1] to try out for an evening. The [Lytro site][1] can explain much better than I can what this camera does:

> The Lytro camera lets you capture and share what you see in a whole new way. It’s the first consumer camera that records the entire light field — all the rays of light traveling in every direction through a scene — instead of a flat 2D image.

This means you can refocus images and change perspective in post-processing. You can do this and export a flat image, or you can upload your photos to the Lytro site and embed them on websites, allowing viewers to focus or alter perspective they way they want.

It&#8217;s an amazing idea. It&#8217;s going to be incredibly useful technology when it&#8217;s ready. At the moment, the photos are very low resolution and the crazy focus  and perspective shifts you&#8217;ll see in the [example images][2] didn&#8217;t seem to happen for the photos I took. It&#8217;s also pretty bad in low light. Still, it&#8217;s a lot of fun, and I can&#8217;t wait to see what the next few iterations bring. Also, it&#8217;s fun watching people get really confused about the weird looking Start Trek type contraption you&#8217;re pointing at things.

## A few examples

I&#8217;ve embedded a few examples of mine here. Try clicking on an area to refocus. Try clicking and dragging to change perspective.

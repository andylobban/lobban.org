Paddy and I are hosting a private-public screening of The Ghost Of Piramida on Saturday 2nd March 2013 in the cinema room of the Banshee Labyrinth in Edinburgh.

In [The Ghost Of Piramida][1] director [Andreas Koefoed][2] follows [Efterklang][3] on their 9 day audio expedition to the ghost town Piramida on Spitsbergen, located just a thousand kilometers from the North Pole and home to more polar bears than people.

Accompanied by their taciturn and not visibly impressed Russian polar bear guard, the group goes on a treasure hunt in the empty buildings of the ghost town, while the narrator, the former Piramida-citizen Alexander, takes us back to a bygone era, when Piramida flourished and the immigrant Russian miners and their families lived in a Soviet parallel society far from the brutal reality of their homeland.

**Efterklang** collected over a thousand sound recordings for the album ‘Piramida’ they later wrote and recorded in Berlin.

The music in the film incorporates some of the early sketches, as well as finished songs from the album.

Screening info: **Saturday 2nd March 2013** in the cinema room of the **Banshee Labyrinth, Edinburgh** at **7.30pm**. The screening is **free** but we have limited space so to **reserve a space** please [email me][4]. I will reply to confirm you’re in.

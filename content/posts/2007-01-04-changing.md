[Nonimage.co.uk][1] is changing slightly in format. The site will from now on be an aggregator for various bits of information I create around the internet, including photos, videos, writing, links, etc. This means much more information added to the site every day. So if you are reading this in an RSS feed, you might want to visit <http://www.nonimage.co.uk/archives/subscribe/> to find out what your options are for keeping up with things but not having your RSS reader flooded. Subscribers to the Nonimage Combined feed should swap immediately to the Nonimage feed at <http://feeds.feedburner.com/nonimage>  
Thanks for your patience.

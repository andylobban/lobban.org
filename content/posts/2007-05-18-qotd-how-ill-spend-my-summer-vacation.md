> Are you taking a vacation this summer (or this season)?&#160; Where are you headed and who's going with you?

This summer I am too broke (so far) to plan a proper holiday. In a few hours I am going to Brighton for the Great Escape Festival, and then I have three more festivals over the summer. They are going to be holiday I suppose, a series of long weekends in mud getting drunk and watching bands. Not a bad way to spend (some of) my summer. I'm also taking a week off work between 2 of the festivals, so Colin and I can stay in festival mood right through, drinking cider all the time, only eating off a barbecue, and wearing shorts even if it rains. Oh yes.

So my summer:

This weekend &#8211; [Great Escape][1]  
Mid July&#160; &#8211; [T In The Park][2] (only Friday and Sunday as I have my friend Laura's wedding on the Saturday)  
The week after &#8211; slumming it festival style  
Weekend after T In The Park &#8211; [Indian Summer][3]  
End of August &#8211; [Connect][4]

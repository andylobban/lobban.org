I was very pleased to be asked to speak at World Usability Day 2018 in Poznań, Poland. I was asked to speak about design systems, but with so much information already out there about the theory and technical points of creating and maintaining a system, I wanted to talk about how those systems affect people. The people who use the products that we build using our design system, but also the people who use the system to build the products. The customers of your design system product: designers, developers, third party suppliers, and more. How can we maintain a system that&#8217;s usable by those people, so they can and will use it to its full extent? My slides are above.
